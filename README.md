# My Tetris
***

This is a Tetris game written in JavaScript designed for modern desktop web browsers. The game generally follows the <a href='https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline'> official Tetris guidelines</a> implementing features from different Tetris games.  

The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by arranging falling tetrominoes. Tetrominoes are made up of four connected squares, arranged in various shapes.

The player must rotate and move the tetrominoes so that they fit into rows at the bottom of the game field (the stack). When a row is filled, it disappears, and the player scores points. As the player clears more rows the level increases, and so does the speed of the game. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

- Control tetrominoes using keyboard input.
- Score and level-up functionality.
